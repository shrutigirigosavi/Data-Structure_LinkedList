# Linked List Using Generic Approach

##  Project Overview
This project implements a **Linked List data structure** using a **generic approach**, allowing the storage and manipulation of different data types. It is designed to strengthen the understanding of core **Data Structure concepts** such as dynamic memory allocation, node linking, and list operations.

##  Objectives
- To implement a linked list using generics
- To perform basic linked list operations
- To understand memory management and dynamic data structures
- To apply theoretical data structure concepts in practical programming

##  Features
- Generic linked list implementation
- Insert elements (beginning, end, specific position)
- Delete elements from the list
- Traverse and display the linked list
- Search for elements
- Efficient memory usage

##  Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Concepts:**  
  - Data Structures  
  - Linked List  
  - Generic Programming  
  - Dynamic Memory Allocation
